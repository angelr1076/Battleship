# Description:

The project features a modern, browser-based version of the classic Battleship game, developed as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. The game allows players to strategically place their ships on a grid and take turns attacking their opponent's ships. The ultimate goal is to sink all of the opponent's ships before they sink yours.

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Key Features:

- Interactive user interface for placing ships and launching attacks on the opponent's grid.
- Utilization of factory functions and the module pattern, as recommended by The Odin Project.
- Responsive design that works seamlessly on various screen sizes and devices.
- In-game messages and instructions to guide players through the game and provide updates on the game state.
- Visually appealing color scheme and design that enhances the overall gaming experience.
- Utilizes Webpack's module bundling along with module tests via Jest testing.
