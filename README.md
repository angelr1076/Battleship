# Battleship - Test Driven Development

[Battleship Screenshot]('./src/images/battleship-screenshot.png')

## The project requirements include:

1. Set up the project structure, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and ensure the game runs on a local development server.

2. Create a 10x10 grid for each player, representing the game board. The grid should display ships and allow players to place them on the board. Implement drag-and-drop functionality for a user-friendly experience.

3. Implement game logic to manage the state of the game, including player turns, hit and miss tracking, ship placement, and game-ending conditions.

4. Utilize JavaScript event listeners to handle user actions, such as clicking on the grid to fire at enemy ships, dragging and dropping ships for placement, and starting a new game.

5. Provide visual feedback to the players, such as highlighting cells when a ship is hit, displaying a "miss" indicator, and updating the score.

6. Ensure that the game is fully responsive, adjusting the layout and user interface elements for different screen sizes and devices.

7. Test the application thoroughly, fixing any bugs or issues that arise.
