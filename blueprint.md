Set up the HTML structure for the game board. This will typically involve creating a table or grid of cells that represent the positions on the board. You can also add buttons or other elements to allow the user to interact with the game.

Create the JavaScript logic for placing the ships on the board. You will need to decide on the size and number of ships, as well as the rules for placing them (e.g., they cannot overlap). You can use JavaScript to randomly generate the positions of the ships or allow the user to place them manually.

Implement the logic for taking turns and making guesses. One player should be able to click on a cell on the board to make a guess, and the game should check whether that cell contains a ship and update the board accordingly. You will also need to track which cells have been guessed and prevent the same cell from being guessed multiple times.

Add logic for detecting when a ship has been sunk. You will need to keep track of which cells belong to each ship and check whether all of them have been guessed. If a ship has been sunk, you should update the board and the game state to reflect this.

Implement the logic for ending the game. This could be when one player has sunk all of the other player's ships, or when all of the cells on the board have been guessed. You should also consider adding a tie-breaker if both players have the same number of ships remaining when the game ends.

Add any additional features or polish that you would like to include in your game. This could include visual effects, sound effects, scoring, or different game modes (e.g., single player against a computer opponent).
